## About Project
___________________________________________________________________________________

This Project includes Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing(NLP), Textblob and Graphical representation of textual and numerical data. The Project analyzes the news headlines of past 20 years to predict what was the financial condition during the intervals. I also loaded the past numerical history of stocks of Tata Steel and then appended both of them to create a complete featured dataset that will help our model to be trained upon. Finally, my model predicted the upcoming stocks information on different intervals of time
